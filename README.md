# Automation Testing with Appium

This is an example that showcase how to use [Appium](http://appium.io/)
for Mobile app automation testing.

[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/) has a (free) 
[Mobile Analyzer](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSYJJF_1.0.0/ApplicationSecurityonCloud/appseccloud_results_samplescans.html) 
app that we can use for this demo.

**DISCLAIMER:** I DON'T KNOW IF THE APP CONTAINS VIRUSES, 
SO USE AT YOUR OWN RISK:speak_no_evil:
